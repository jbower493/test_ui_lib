Key things that made it work:

- JSX: 'react' in tsconfig
- adding react as peer dep in package.json
- "files" property in package.json
- externals: "react": "react" in webpack config
- library: name: 'ui_lib', type: 'umd' in webpack config
- import React from 'react' in index.ts file as well as Button.tsx
